# Sustainability for Hosts

As the internet grows, so does the environmental impact of hosting websites. Sustainable web hosting helps to reduce carbon emissions and improves energy efficiency. Here are some key factors to consider when selecting a sustainable hosting provider and best practices for reducing the environmental footprint of web hosting.


## Energy Efficiency

Using energy-efficient servers and cooling systems and consolidating underutilized servers is important to a host's sustainability efforts. The biggest improvement to hosting in the past decade is using virtualization to reduce physical server needs. Using SSDs (Solid-State Drives) instead of HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) also increases energy efficiency. To further reduce energy consumption, hosting providers can implement cloud hosting and serverless architectures to allocate resources dynamically based on demand.


## Renewable Energy Use

Hosting providers can reduce their environmental impact by powering or utilizing data centers with renewable energy sources. Investing in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, or hydroelectric power can substantially improve the environmental impact.


## Green Data Centers

Data centers with green certifications (e.g., LEED, ISO 50001) are optimized for energy efficiency. Providers can also select data centers in cooler climates like Iceland to minimize cooling needs.


## Regional Data Centers 

Where possible, offer region-specific hosting options to minimize data transfer. Educate customers to understand the benefits of local data centers. Add a CDN to accommodate international traffic in an efficient manner.


## Employee and Office Sustainability 

Sustainability efforts should go beyond data centers and servers. If you’re using an office, make sure that your office building is green and energy efficient. Implement recycling programs within your offices, use energy-efficient lightning and encourage paperless operations. Promote remote work to reduce overall carbon footprint associated with daily commutes and office energy consumption. 


## Sustainable Data Management

Effective data management practices help reduce the storage footprint of web hosting. Using incremental backups avoids unnecessary data storage. Regularly archiving or deleting unused data and optimizing databases and storage systems minimize redundancy. Implementing data minification and image compression technologies can improve data management and decrease the storage footprint of individual websites. 


## Optimize Performance

Optimizing performance is crucial for reducing server load and energy consumption. Hosting providers can implement server-side caching (e.g. Redis or Memcached) to minimize database queries and CPU usage. Static and dynamic caching can be added for reducing server usage for static and dynamic content like HTML and PHP, reducing RAM and CPU usage. Offer built-in performance optimization for WordPress like minification, data cleanup and image compression. 


## Security is paramount

Raise awareness with your customers around the impact of security on everything. Hackers and dangerous bots can overload your servers and generate unwanted power and data impacts. We recommend to at least use a tool like WP Scan or Pathstack to make sure you are aware of vulnerability and can react to it. 


## Use Longevity Hardware

Servers and hardware should be managed responsibly by keeping it as long as possible, using it as efficiently as possible, making sure it is certified, and purchasing long-lifespan products. Once they reach their end-of-life make sure to recover, recycle, and upcycle. 


## Reduce the Amount of Unused Resources

Testing and staging environments are nice and great to have around - if your customers actually use them. Make sure your customers can easily create and destroy those environments so they feel safe to not keep them around. Each unused environment still consumes storage and computing space, even if there is no traffic to the application.


## Reinvestment in Carbon and Environmental Projects

There are many ways a hosting company can improve its environmental impact. Charities and companies like [https://onetreeplanted.org](https://onetreeplanted.org/) and [https://theoceancleanup.com](https://theoceancleanup.com/) provide a great way to help compensate for impacts, considering that the first priority should be to avoid and reduce them.


## Educate Your Customers

Educate your customers about the importance of sustainable web hosting and what they can do to improve their own site’s footprint. Provide educational resources like tutorials, webinars and interactive tools measuring websites’ footprint and suggesting tips to improve site efficiency. 


## Track progress

Make sure to check your initial baseline to always be able to see progress and compare it.


## Continuous Improvement and Auditing

Sustainability is an ongoing commitment. Hosting providers should regularly audit their energy, water, and waste management practices and continually stay updated on the latest technologies to improve their environmental performance.
