# WordPress Hosting Live

The WordPress Hosting Team held a series of remote live meetups that were focused on teaching concepts related to hosting and using WordPress

The WordPress Hosting Live meetups group can be found at [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/learn-wordpress-online-workshops/), brought to you by the [Make Hosting Team](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/) in collaboration with the [Learn WordPress Team](https://learn.wordpress.org/). You can find event archives on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHFMCXJxXHcfls9w6Hzt6A) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WPHostingTeam).

## What is it?

The Hosting Live events project streamed events that allowed knowledgable parties to direct the event as a host and offer a presentation on a particular WordPress hosting related topic, followed by discourse, questions and answers. The events were streamed on YouTube live.

## The topics

The subject of the web-hosting focused events were:

* Server Environment (PHP, MySQL, nginx...)
* Web Performance (caching, CDN, configuration...)
* Reliability (backups, monitoring...)
* Security (firewall, permissions, updates...)

### Level of presentations

The talks were inclusive to users of any skill level. Some of the original ideas for presentations included titles like:

* WordPress and the new PHP version
* How we manage updates and maintenance
* Optimizing hosting for WordPress sites
* Complex and distributed WordPress installations

## Languages

Although the main language used in the WordPress Community is English, and the main language of the presentations were also English, presentations in other languages were included, as goals of this initiative were to reach as many people as possible, regardless of where they are or what language they speak.

## Presentations

As with any WordPress event, there are a number of limitations that apply across the board. These are included for the good of the global WordPress Community.

* The first slide must include the title of the presentation, the name of the speaker and, if it is a derivative work, the original authors.
* The second slide must include a presentation card of the speaker(s). In this slide the speaker can give credit to the company or business relationship sponsoring the contributor or speaker, including logos, social media and other marketing materials of the speaker and their sponsorship.
* The rest of the slides may not include any mention or commercial logos. As a general rule, no hashtags or social network accounts may be included.
* The last slide can include a closing message (in Thank You! mode) as well as a link to the speaker's personal website, personal email account or personal social networks, in case anyone viewing the presentation wants to get in touch.
* The presentation must be under GPL or compatible licenses (EUPL, etc...).
* The [Code of Conduct](https://learn.wordpress.org/code-of-conduct/) must be observed at all times.
