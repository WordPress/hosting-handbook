# WordPress Hosting Live

The WordPress Hosting Team promotes a series of live events focused on teaching elements promoted by the team and reaching all users.

The main WordPress Hosting Live site will be at [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/learn-wordpress-online-workshops/), hosted at [Make Hosting](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/) and in collaboration with the [Learn WordPress](https://learn.wordpress.org/) team. You can also find the streaming at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUHFMCXJxXHcfls9w6Hzt6A) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/WPHostingTeam).

## What is it?

The original idea of this project was to have streaming events in which a person directs the event as a host, and one or more people give a presentation on a particular topic. Afterwards, there would be a round of questions and answers. The initial platform for broadcasting will be YouTube live, although other systems may be considered.

Other alternative systems can be to have group conversations in Zoom mode in which everyone can participate more dynamically.

## The topics

The subject of these events have to be around the world of hosting and what the team usually works on. Among them we can have:

* Server Environment (PHP, MySQL, nginx...)
* Web Performance (caching, CDN, configuration...)
* Reliability (backups, monitoring...)
* Security (firewall, permissions, updates...)

### Level of presentations

The talks can be directed to users of any level. While it is true that local Meetups tend to reach all types of users, this channel was designed to raise the level of hosting professionals and teach or discuss topics that are not usually covered.

Some ideas for presentation titles:

* WordPress and the new PHP version
* How we manage updates and maintenance
* Optimizing hosting for WordPress sites
* Complex and distributed WordPress installations

## Languages

Although the main language used in the WordPress Community is English, and the main language of the presentations (initially established once a month) will also be English, presentations in other languages will be included from time to time, in an effort to ensure that the goals of this initiative will reach as many people as possible, regardless of where they are or what language they speak. The more people we can reach, the better!

## Presentations

As with any WordPress event, there are a number of limitations that apply across the board. These are included for the good of the global WordPress Community.

* The first slide will include the title of the presentation, the name of the speaker and, if it is a derivative work, the original authors.
* The second slide will include a presentation card of the speaker(s). In this slide you can inform about the company or business relationship you have, include logos, the page and social networks of the speaker.
* The rest of the slides may not include any mention or commercial logos. As a general rule, no hashtags or social network accounts may be included.
* The last slide can include a closing message (in Thank You! mode) as well as a link to the speaker's personal website, personal email account or personal social networks, in case anyone viewing the presentation wants to get in touch.
* The presentation must be under GPL or compatible licenses (EUPL, etc...).
* The [Code of Conduct](https://learn.wordpress.org/code-of-conduct/) must be observed at all times.
