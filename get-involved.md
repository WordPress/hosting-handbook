# Get Involved

## What does the Hosting Team do?

The Hosting Team is working on [several projects](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/team-projects/).

There is a set of hosting best practices in the [Hosting Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/), including [Performance](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/performance/), [Reliability](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/reliability/), [Security](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/security/) and [Server Environment](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/handbook/server-environment/) recommendations.

The team also runs and maintains a set of [automated hosting tests](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/test-results/) that run across many hosting companies. You can set up tests to run on your hosting environment(s), and help improve the tools through fixing bugs, adding features, or improving the design of the test reporter pages.

#### Improving Hosting Handbook

The Handbook contains information about the Hosting Team, along with hosting recommendations for running WordPress.

The recommendations were put together by the team and used as a basis for [Site Health recommendations](https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/appendix/troubleshooting-using-the-health-check/) in WordPress. They're meant both as a reference for folks learning to host WordPress, and a way to help WordPress and Hosts improve together.

##### How to contribute to the Hosting Handbook

The handbook is in the process of being audited and improved. You can see the progress and contribute [through Github](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook).

The first thing you'll have to do is [visit the repository page](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook) where all the information is. It's best to [visit the Issues list](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook/issues), check if your proposal is already contemplated or pending, and if it isn't, [create a New issue](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook/issues/new).

After you submit an issue, we can discuss together the suggested changes.

#### Improvements in the development of the Automated Hosting Tests

You can propose improvements or solve those available in both the [PHPUnit test runner (issues)](https://github.com/WordPress/phpunit-test-runner/issues) and the [PHPUnit test reporter (issues)](https://github.com/WordPress/phpunit-test-reporter/issues).

The Runner repo contains the parts of the hosting tests that run on a host, and the Reporter repo contains the plugin that runs on WordPress.org for receiving and displaying the tests.

### First Steps for New Contributors

#### Slack

You can find the global WordPress Slack at [wordpress.slack.com](https://wordpress.slack.com/). A signup and walkthrough are available at [chat.wordpress.org](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/). When you are in, find the [#hosting-community](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/hosting-community/) channel.

You can [sign up](https://wordpress.slack.com/signup) using your WordPress.org username. If you don't have one, [create a WordPress profile](https://login.wordpress.org/register)) and you'll be able to create an account as "MyWordPressUsername@chat.wordpress.org", replacing "MyWordPressUsername" with your WordPress.org username.

#### Meetings: What to expect

The meeting is usually to connect about WordPress happenings throughout the week connected with hosting and to catch up on the status of the team's ongoing projects.

The agenda usually consists of the following topics:

*   Greetings
*   Highlights
*   Hosting Team tasks
*   Open Floor

During the **Greetings** we do a "Wave in" to get an overview who is in for the meeting and check how everyone is doing. New attendees are welcomed to introduce themselves.

In the **Highlights** section the team talks about the latest happenings in the WordPress space and their impacts on hosts. Examples are new WordPress releases, new proposals or WordCamp.

The **Hosting Team tasks** part of the meeting focuses on open tasks or issues on hosting related projects like the Handbook or the Automated Hosting Tests. Additionally, we handle requests from other teams here.

Everything else up for discussion will be handled during the **Open Floor**. Every attendee can bring up topics here to discuss or just to inform hosts.

#### Meetings: Taking notes

Taking meeting notes is a great way to help out!

During each meeting, we try to create a post with a synopsis of what is chatted about, to make it easier for those who can't attend to follow along. You can see examples of notes from previous meetings on the [Hosting Team's Make site](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/tag/weekly-hosting-chat/).

There's always a need for more folks to join! If you're interested in helping out with taking notes, chat with one of the Team Reps for access to the team's [make site](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/wp-admin/). Once you have access, you'll be able to start with templates of previous meeting notes.

You can check out recommendations on style in this [Core Handbook page](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/post-comment-guidelines/). They don't all apply because it's a guide from Core — the biggest thing is to be careful not to accidentally representing WordPress.org or the team if it's not a WordPress.org or team decision, and to get peer review before posting.

Feel free to ask in the main [#hosting-community](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/hosting-community/) channel for review, or any of the Team Reps directly if you don't get a reply right away.

### Getting Started at Contributing

If you've never been on the Hosting Team before and you want to contribute, a good time to start is on a Contributor Day. You can check to see if your nearest community has a Hosting team, and if not, you can always participate in the Contributor Days associated with WCAsia ([WordCamp Asia](https://asia.wordcamp.org/)), WCEU ([WordCamp Europe](https://europe.wordcamp.org/)) and WCUS ([WordCamp US](https://us.wordcamp.org/)).

Also, you can access the [#hosting-community](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/hosting-community/) channel on Slack, check it and start participating. We always have something to do!
