# Team Reps

The WordPress initiative boasts a global array of contributors engaged in a variety of roles, ranging from coding and support to translations, event organization, documentation writing, and plugin and theme reviews. These diverse roles contribute significantly to the project's ongoing success and development.

These participants are organized into specific project teams, each of which has a dedicated space on the make.wordpress.org network for discussing and sharing updates about their contributions.

It's essential for each team to select at least two Team Representatives. These representatives act as liaisons between their respective teams and the larger WordPress project, ensuring that concerns are appropriately voiced and addressed, and facilitating collaborations between teams.

## Hosting Team Organization

### Team Reps

Within the extensive ecosystem of WordPress, different teams work together to ensure the platform's ongoing development and success. Each of these teams has at least one representative, often referred to as a 'Team Rep'. For the Hosting Team, the Team Rep plays a vital role.

#### Role of the Hosting Team Rep

A Team Rep, specifically from the Hosting team, acts as the voice and ambassador of the Hosting Team within the broader WordPress Community. Their tasks are multifaceted:

1. **Representation:** The Team Rep acts as the primary point of contact for the Hosting Team, representing their interests, challenges, and achievements to the larger WordPress Community.
  
2. **Information Exchange:** The Team Rep acts as a conduit for communication, facilitating the exchange of crucial information, such as project updates and strategic decisions, with representatives from other teams and the leadership of the WordPress project.

3. **Meeting Facilitator:** The role of the Team Rep includes ensuring that the weekly team meetings are conducted as scheduled. Their responsibilities involve encouraging team members to contribute to the creation of the agenda, collecting topics for discussion, and facilitating the meeting itself. Importantly, the role of Meeting Facilitator is not limited to Team Reps; any team member is eligible to run the meeting.

#### Team Rep Responsibilities

- **Rotation of Duties:** The Hosting team ensures that there are at least two Team Reps. Ideally, one rep takes on the primary responsibilities for the first half of the term, while the other serves in a backup capacity. In the second half of the term, the roles switch. This structure ensures continuity, as the backup rep has spent about three months learning the nuances of the role before taking the primary responsibilities.

- **Monthly Updates:** The primary Team Rep shoulders the responsibility of posting a monthly update of the Hosting team's activities on the Make/Updates blog. This update might include progress reports, challenges faced, and any other critical developments. Furthermore, they must highlight any issues or concerns that other teams within the community need to be cognizant of. In the event the primary rep is unavailable to post the update, the backup rep must ensure it's done. A lapse of updates spanning 3 months will result in the need to appoint new reps who can maintain these duties.

- **Quarterly Reports:** All teams, including Hosting, are encouraged to contribute to a quarterly progress report. This report comprises details such as contact points within the team, the team's current and most recent priorities, challenges they're navigating, and their most noteworthy achievements.

#### The Team Rep Voting Procedure

In order to maintain transparent and democratic governance within the Hosting Team, a structured voting process for selecting Team Representatives is in place. The current running Hosting Team Reps are responsible for this process. This process unfolds annually and consists of distinct phases: the nomination period and the voting window.

- **Nomination Phase:** The nomination period typically takes place in December of each year. During this phase, any active member of the Hosting Team can either nominate themselves or recommend a colleague for the Team Rep position. The Hosting Team will publish a "Call for Nominees" on make.wordpress.org/hosting, where everyone can comment with their nominations. If preferred, nominations can also be sent anonymously to a trusted Team Rep via Direct Messages on Slack.

- **Voting:** Following the conclusion of the nomination period, a two-week voting window is opened. All active Hosting Team members are encouraged to cast their vote for their preferred candidates within this timeframe. The hosting team will create a survey to collect those votes anonymized and will publish the results afterwards on make.wordpress.org/hosting. 

After the voting period concludes, the nominees with the most votes are contacted to confirm whether they wish to accept the Team Rep role. Once confirmations are received, the new Team Reps are officially announced on make.wordpress.org/hosting.

### Project Leads

In the diverse and collaborative environment of the WordPress Community, each team is involved in various projects to help make WordPress better for all its users. Within the Hosting Team, a crucial role exists: the Project Lead.

#### Role of a Project Lead

A Project Lead is responsible for guiding and overseeing a specific project under the purview of the Hosting Team. They steer the project towards its objectives, ensuring quality, consistency, and timeliness. Their tasks range from planning and setting milestones to coordinating with team members and stakeholders. Based on the nature of the project, the requirements and skills for a Project Lead may differ. It is important to note that any member of the Hosting Team can assume the role of Project Lead by volunteering and coordinating with the Hosting Team Representative. A Project Lead does not need to be a Team Representative, and vice versa.
