- **Monitor and evaluate** new PHP versions, databases (MySQL/MariaDB), and web servers to ensure WordPress compatibility and performance
- **Provide technical resources** that help the WordPress community make informed decisions about their hosting infrastructure
- **Advocate for WordPress** within the hosting industry and represent hosting needs within the broader WordPress project
