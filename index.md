## About the Hosting Team

The WordPress Hosting Team consists of experienced professionals dedicated to bridging the gap between WordPress and hosting environments. Our members include system administrators, hosting providers, plugin developers, and server infrastructure experts who are passionate about optimizing WordPress performance and reliability in production environments.

### Our Mission

We believe that great hosting experiences enable WordPress to thrive. Our team works to:

- **Publish authoritative documentation** on hosting best practices, server configurations, and environment recommendations for WordPress deployments
- **Maintain compatibility guides** that help hosting providers and site owners understand which server environments work best with each WordPress release
- **Monitor and evaluate** new PHP versions, databases (MySQL/MariaDB), and web servers to ensure WordPress compatibility and performance
- **Provide technical resources** that help the WordPress community make informed decisions about their hosting infrastructure
- **Advocate for WordPress** within the hosting industry and represent hosting needs within the broader WordPress project

### What We Do

We focus on publishing documentation about best practices for hosting WordPress and providing tools to help improve WordPress performance when new versions and different elements of its environment (such as PHP, the database, and the web server) appear.
