## About the Hosting Team

Hosting Team members are typically professionals in the web hosting industry; system administrators, support technicians, software engineers, plugin developers, etc., who are invested in supporting a relationship between WordPress and WordPress web hosts.

The team's goals and projects are focused on facilitating collaboration between the WordPress Open Source Project and Web Hosts, through distributed testing on hosting systems and documentation on best practices as applicable to hosting WordPress.
