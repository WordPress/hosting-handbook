# Hosting Projects

The projects of the Hosting team can vary, in addition to being able to cross with those of other teams.

Currently the list of projects to contribute is:

- [WordPress Hosting Team Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/), focused on documentation.
- [Automated Hosting Tests](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/test-results/), focused on PHP compatibility.
- [Advanced Admin Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/advanced-administration/), focused on documentation, in collaboration with the [Documentation Team](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/).

## WordPress Hosting Team Handbook

### What

The Handbook contains information about the Hosting Team, along with hosting recommendations for running WordPress.

The recommendations were put together by the team and used as a basis for [Site Health recommendations](https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/appendix/troubleshooting-using-the-health-check/) in WordPress. They're meant both as a reference for folks learning to host WordPress, and a way to help WordPress and Hosts improve together.

### Skills

- Technical writing
- Systems Administration

_Those skills are not required, but help._

### How

The handbook is in the process of being audited and improved. You can see the progress and contribute [through Github](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook).

The first thing you'll have to do is [visit the repository page](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook) where all the information is. It's best to [visit the Issues list](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook/issues), check if your proposal is already contemplated or pending, and if it isn't, [create a New issue](https://github.com/WordPress/hosting-handbook/issues/new).

After you submit an issue, we can discuss together the suggested changes.

Once a PR is submitted, it will require an approval process. By default, once it is submitted, it will require review and approval by two people from the Hosting team. In cases where there are PRs related to corrections or internal operational elements, created by someone from the Hosting Team, only one review will be required.

## Advanced Admin Handbook

### What

This new documentation is proposed as advanced regarding what currently exists for end users ([UserHub / Support](https://wordpress.org/support/)), with the goal that the documentation for users is free of advanced technical material, and that the documentation for developers ([DevHub](https://developer.wordpress.org/)) is very differentiated between what is development, and what are advanced development or system configurations.

### Skills

- Technical writing

_Those skills are not required, but help._

### How

Although we are still in a first step, if you know of other WordPress content that could be in this Handbook, please [open an issue](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/issues) and discuss it with the Documentation team. Please use the label ["advanced administration"](https://github.com/WordPress/Documentation-Issue-Tracker/labels/advanced%20administration).

If you want to help launch the Handbook as soon as possible, [please take an issue and work on it](https://github.com/zzap/WordPress-Advanced-administration-handbook/issues). You can comment on the site itself if you have any questions, suggestions or improvements.
