# Server Environment

Although WordPress can work in almost any environment, even very minimal ones, it must be acknowledged that it does not work completely well in these. That's why here we are going to make some minimum recommendations of the environment in which it would work most effectively when considering that most WordPress websites use third party plugins and themes which commonly introduce additional server-level requirements.

## Web Server

The web server is piece of software that accepts user web requests and serves them the appropriate result. There are many different web servers that run on different operation systems. Generally, if your web server supports and executes PHP files, it should be able to work with WordPress.

The two most popular ones that are recommended are:

* [Apache HTTPD](https://httpd.apache.org/) 2.4
* [nginx](https://nginx.org/) 1.24

Others are used by hosting companies and developers and are known to work well too:

* [LiteSpeed Web Server](https://www.litespeedtech.com/products/litespeed-web-server) 6.1 / 6.0 / 5.4
* [OpenLiteSpeed](https://openlitespeed.org/) 1.7

_Those are the latest versions at the time of writing this document. Always keep your web server up-to-date to ensure best performance!_

## PHP

PHP is a programming language on which WordPress code is based. This language runs on the server and it is important to keep it up to date, both for security and functionality.

WordPress supports many versions of PHP, some even obsolete ([PHP Compatibility and WordPress Versions](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/php-compatibility-and-wordpress-versions/)), for hosting companies we recommend:

**WordPress 6.4**

* [PHP 8.1](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#PHP_8_1)
* [PHP 8.2](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#PHP_8_2)

_IMPORTANT: WordPress 6.4 is **compatible with exceptions** with PHP 8.0, PHP 8.1, and PHP 8.2, and **beta compatible** with PHP 8.3._

_What "compatible with exceptions" means?_

- PHP 8.0
	- [Named parameters](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/59649). WordPress does not support named parameters.
	- [Filesystem WP_Filesystem_FTPext and WP_Filesystem_SSH2 when connect fails](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/48689).

- PHP 8.1
	- Not all "passing null to non-nullable" issues have been found.
	- [htmlentities() et al needs the default value of the flags parameter explicitly set](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/53465).
	- [Replace most strip_tags() with wp_strip_tags()](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/57579).

- PHP 8.2
	- [utf8_{encode|decode} deprecation](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55603) with pending decision on requiring a PHP extension.
	- [Unknown dynamic properties](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/56034) deprecations.

_What "beta" means?_

- PHP 8.3
	- Deprecation notices: A deprecation notice is not an error, but rather an indicator of where additional work is needed for compatibility before PHP 9.0. With a deprecation notice, the PHP code will continue to work and nothing is broken.

**WordPress 6.3**

* [PHP 8.1](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#PHP_8_1)
* [PHP 8.2](https://www.php.net/ChangeLog-8.php#PHP_8_2)

_IMPORTANT: WordPress 6.3 is **compatible with exceptions** with PHP 8.0 and PHP 8.1, and **beta compatible** with PHP 8.2._

_What "compatible with exceptions" means?_

- PHP 8.0
	- Named parameters. WordPress does not support named parameters.

### About PHP

PHP 8.0 is maintained by the PHP Community only as _Security fix only_ starting 2022-11-26. Keeping your PHP to the latest stable version is important for WordPress speed and security.

Versions prior to PHP 7.4 are not maintained by the PHP Community, although they may receive security updates from operating systems distributions. Security support for PHP 7.4 ended in 2022-11-06 which means that even if there are security problems with it, official versions won't be released.

### PHP Extensions

WordPress core makes use of various PHP extensions when they're available. If the preferred extension is missing WordPress will either have to do more work to do the task the module helps with or, in the worst case, will remove functionality. All the extensions are for installations with PHP >= 7.4.

The PHP extensions listed below are _required_ for a WordPress site to work.

* [json](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.json.php) (bundled in >=8.0.0) - Used for communications with other servers and processing data in JSON format.
* One of either [mysqli](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mysqli.php) (bundled in >=5.0.0), or [mysqlnd](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mysqlnd.php) - Connects to MySQL for database interactions.

The PHP extensions listed below are _highly recommended_ in order to allow WordPress to operate optimally and to maximise compatibility with many popular plugins and themes.

*   [curl](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) (PHP >= 7.3 requires libcurl >= 7.15.5; PHP >= 8.0 requires libcurl >= 7.29.0) - Performs remote request operations.
*   [dom](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php) (requires libxml) - Used to validate Text Widget content and to automatically configure IIS7+.
*   [exif](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.exif.php) (requires php-mbstring) - Works with metadata stored in images.
*   [fileinfo](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.fileinfo.php) (bundled in PHP) - Used to detect mimetype of file uploads.
*   [hash](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.hash.php) (bundled in PHP >=5.1.2) - Used for hashing, including passwords and update packages.
*   [igbinary](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.igbinary.php) - Increases performance as a drop in replacement for the standard PHP serializer.
*   [imagick](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.imagick.php) (requires ImageMagick >= 6.2.4) - Provides better image quality for media uploads. See [WP\_Image\_Editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_image_editor/) for details. Smarter image resizing (for smaller images) and PDF thumbnail support, when Ghost Script is also available.
*   [intl](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php) (PHP >= 7.4.0 requires ICU >= 50.1) - Enable to perform locale-aware operations including but not limited to formatting, transliteration, encoding conversion, calendar operations, conformant collation, locating text boundaries and working with locale identifiers, timezones and graphemes.
*   [mbstring](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) - Used to properly handle UTF8 text.
*   [openssl](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.openssl.php) (PHP 7.1-8.0 requires OpenSSL >= 1.0.1 / < 3.0; PHP >= 8.1 requires OpenSSL >= 1.0.2 / < 4.0) - SSL-based connections to other hosts.
*   [pcre](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pcre.php) (bundled in PHP >= 7.0 recommended PCRE 8.10) - Increases performance of pattern matching in code searches.
*   [xml](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.xml.php) (requires libxml) - Used for XML parsing, such as from a third-party site.
*   [zip](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.zip.php) (requires libzip >= 0.11; recommended libzip >= 1.6) - Used for decompressing Plugins, Themes, and WordPress update packages.

The PHP extensions listed below are _recommended_ to allow some WordPress cache (if necessary). APCu, Memcached, and Redis are alternatives of which only one needs to be used.

*   [apcu](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.apcu.php) – In-memory key-value store for PHP (former APC stripped of opcode caching).
*   [memcached](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.memcached.php) (requires libmemcached >= 1.0.0) - memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.
*   [opcache](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php) - PHP can be configured to preload scripts into the opcache when the engine starts. 
*   [redis](https://pecl.php.net/package/redis) - PHP extension for interfacing with Redis.

For the sake of completeness, below is a list of the remaining PHP modules WordPress _may_ use in certain situations or if other modules are unavailable. These are fallbacks or optional and not necessarily needed in an optimal environment, but installing them won't hurt.

*   [bc](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bc.php) - For arbitrary precision mathematics, which supports numbers of any size and precision up to 2147483647 decimal digits.

*   [image](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) (requires libgd >= 2.1.0; requires zlib >= 1.2.0.4; optional freetype2) - If Imagick isn't installed, the GD Graphics Library is used as a functionally limited fallback for image manipulation.
*   [iconv](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.iconv.php) (requires libiconv/POSIX) - Used to convert between character sets.
*   [shmop](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.shmop.php) - Shmop is an easy to use set of functions that allows PHP to read, write, create and delete Unix shared memory segments.
*   [simplexml](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.simplexml.php) (requires libxml) - Used for XML parsing.
*   [sodium](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.sodium.php) - (bundled in PHP >=7.2.0; requires libsodium >= 1.0.8) - Validates Signatures and provides securely random bytes.
*   [xmlreader](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.xmlreader.php) (requires libxml) - Used for XML parsing.
*   [zlib](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.zlib.php) (requires zlib >= 1.2.0.4) - Gzip compression and decompression.

These extensions are used for file changes, such as updates and plugin/theme installation, when files aren't writeable on the server.

*   [ssh2](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.ssh2.php) (requires OpenSSL and libssh >= 1.2; recommended libssh >= 1.2.9) - Provide access to resources (shell, remote exec, tunneling, file transfer) on a remote machine using a secure cryptographic transport.

*   [sockets](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.sockets.php) - Implements a low-level interface to the socket communication functions based on the popular BSD sockets.

The priority of the transports are Direct file IO, SSH2, FTP PHP Extension, FTP implemented with Sockets, and FTP implemented through PHP alone.

### System Packages

*   [curl](https://curl.se/) (recommended >= 8.4)
*   [Ghost Script](https://www.ghostscript.com/) (recommended Ghost Script >= 10.0)- Enables Imagick/ImageMagick to generate PDF thumbnails for the media library. See [Enhanced PDF Support in WordPress 4.7](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/11/15/enhanced-pdf-support-4-7/) for details.
*   [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) (recommended ImageMagick >= 7.1) - Required by Imagick extension.

Although WordPress may run on older versions, it is recommended to use these or newer ones for security and performance reasons.

## How do I know which version I have?

If you have WordPress 5.2+, the WordPress Admin already has tools with that information in the `Site Health` section (at `Tools` in the menu).

If you have an older version, you can activate the `Site Health` section installing the WordPress Community Plugin called [Health Check & Troubleshooting](https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/) (more [help for this plugin](https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/appendix/troubleshooting-using-the-health-check/)).
