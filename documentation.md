# Documentation

Here, you’ll find a list of websites, documents, or general materials that you need to check out regularly to keep the WordPress, PHP, MySQL, MariaDB version documentation, or anything related to the Hosting Team, up to date.

Ideally, at least once a month, and with each release of WordPress versions, all these elements should be reviewed and kept up to date.

## WordPress Hosting Team Handbook

### Environment

[Server Environment](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/server-environment/)

This page displays information regarding the ideal environment for each version of WordPress.

It keeps a record of stable versions of web servers, the compatibility of PHP with each major WordPress version and any possible exceptions, the lifespan of PHP, recommended PHP extensions, and compatible databases.

This information may not necessarily align with that of Core, as it is specifically targeted at hosting companies and their systems, not development.


### Compatibility

[WordPress Compatibility](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/compatibility/)

This page displays the compatibility of servers available at the time a new WordPress version is released. This way, if you need to set up a WordPress with that specific version, you can know which stable technology was available at that time.

Additionally, the page includes a list of the minimum requirements that have existed over time, serving as a sort of changelog.

### Upgrading

[Upgrading WordPress](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/upgrading/)

On this page, the steps to update WordPress versions from very old to new are explained. The process is designed so that technology is switched out at each step without losing information, aiming to ensure everything is as compatible as possible.

## WordPress Project

### Requirements

[Requirements](https://wordpress.org/about/requirements/)

The Requirements page has two distinct blocks of information.

The first one lists the recommended versions for the current WordPress release, covering both PHP as well as MySQL and MariaDB.

The second one is a paragraph that documents the minimum supported versions of PHP, MySQL, and MariaDB.

### WordPress and PHP

[PHP Compatibility and WordPress Versions](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/php-compatibility-and-wordpress-versions/)

This page is dependent on the Core team and is maintained for each version of WordPress. It includes a table specifying compatibility with PHP versions, possible exceptions, and the "beta" status.

## Hosting Team Projects

### Projects

[Hosting Projects](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/get-involved/team-projects/)

Here are all the projects from the Hosting Team. Primarily, these are tools and documentation.

This list needs to be kept up to date, with the possibility of individuals participating in them through the Five for the Future project.

### Tests

[Tests](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/tests/)

The Tests page includes information about testing tools.

Keep in mind that there are some requirements for the tools to function that are not the usual ones (like NodeJS), and these need to be synchronized with the Test Team.

### Learn

[Learn Hosting](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/learn-hosting/)

WordPress has a lot of videos, courses and manuals related to Hosting and system administration.

It’s necessary to validate that the content remains current, in addition to being able to add more material that emerges from various sources like Learn WordPress, WordPress.tv, and even articles on different blogs within the WordPress network.

## General Information

### Team Reps

[Team Reps](https://make.wordpress.org/hosting/handbook/get-involved/team-reps/)

Information about the Team Reps, which should be updated annually or as changes occur, in addition to possible alterations in the onboarding and offboarding processes, like access to tools, Slack channels, or any other ongoing developments.
